Queue
-----

TIME COMPLEXITIES : O(1)
LINKED LIST IMPL : Doubly LL --> have two pointer one at first and other at last
ARRAYDEQUEUE -> (dynamic size array or circular array) but as per JAVA TC : amortized O(1)

Insert add(e) offer(e) --> returns boolean generally(true -> if successfully added, false --> if not able to add)

Difference : Inserts the specified element into the queue if its possible to do so immediately without violeting capacity restrictions. When using a
capacity-restricted queue, this method is generally preferrable over add , which can fail an element only by throwing an exception.

offer -> returns false even when we try to add beyond the capacity while add throws an exception in this case.


Remove remove() poll()
Difference : Only in the behavior when queue is empty. the remove method throws an exception while the poll method returns null.



Examine element() peek()
Retriever, but does not remove, the head of the queue. element() is differes from peek() only in that it throws an exception when queue is empty



Applications of Queue
---------------------

1. Single resource and multiple consumers
2. Synchronization btw slow and fast devices
    for ex : keyboard(slow) and processors(fast)
    router use queue between high bandwidth and lB signals
3. In operating systems(Semaphores, FCFS Scheduling, Spooling(in printers), buffer for devices like keyboard)
4. In computer networks ( Routers/Switches and mail queues)
5. Variations : Deque, Priority Queue, Doubly ended priority queue


----------------------------
                        -> LinkedList(mainly doubly linkedlist)
Collections     -> Queue
                        -> ArrayDeque(use array)


Prefer : ArrayDeque
    - Since array, cache friendly and faster

TIME COMPLEXITIES : BOTH IS O(1)
    Array : amortized 1
    LinkedList : Always 1

    so if perticular about operations that no operation should take more than O(1) then go with LL since its worst case is O(1)
