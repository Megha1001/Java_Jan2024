ArrayDeque



Note : Queue interface is different from list interface. List also inherits from collection but queue and list, they are sepearate
So, whatever list specific functionalities are there. They are not there in the classes, which implement queu interface only.
For example : Getting an item at a given index, setting an item at a given index.

Get and set are there in the LL so LL class is a class that implements both deque and List interface.

The great thing about array deque is it is faster than LL on average, because its an array implementation and it can be used as a Stack.
It can be used as a queue and it can be used as a dequeue also.
