Sorting in Java
-----------------------
In two classes
- Arrays -> normal arrays
    - Arrays of primitive(int, char etc)
        -> Stability doesn't matter and we can use non stable algo like Dual Pivot Quick Sort
    - Arrays of Objects (String , Integer, Students etc)
     -> Stability matters and we should use stable algo like Based on Merge sort adaption of TimSort
    -> subarray sorting present

- Collections --> for collections that implements List interface (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector)
    -> Stability matters and we should use stable algo like Based on Merge sort adaption of TimSort
    ->subsorting not present

- Comparable, Comparator
    Fact : If result is +ve , swap
