- For every node, keys in left side are smaller and keys in right sides are greater
- All keys are typically considered as distinct
- Like linked list its a linked data structure.(Not cache friendly)
- Implemented using TreeMap and TreeSet in java(Self balancing BST)


- Below operations in BST are O(H), hence height matters it will become O(N) for skew trees
    - Insert
    - Delete
    - Search
    - FindCloset
Note : But in case of self BST ==> Operations are O(logn)
