- For every node, keys in left side are smaller and keys in right sides are greater
- All keys are typically considered as distinct
- Like linked list its a linked data structure.(Not cache friendly)
- Implemented using TreeMap and TreeSet in java(Self balancing BST)


- Below operations in BST are O(H), hence height matters it will become O(N) for skew trees
    - Insert
    - Delete
    - Search
    - FindCloset
Note : But in case of self BST ==> Operations are O(logn)
Ideally we want to have Balanced BST

- Inorder traversal of BST is always sorted

--------------------------------------
Deletion in BST (after deletion it should still be BST)
- if key to be deleted
    - leaf --> direct delete
    - node with one child --> delete node and fill its position with one child
    - node with two child --> since inorder traversal of BST is sorted. Hence, it would be immediate successor that we will replace(can we immediate predecessor)


------------------------------------------------------
Self balancing BST
- make sure to keep the height as O(logN) so below operations can be done in O(LogN) time
    - search
    - insert
    - delete
    - FindCloset

    Note : Above functions complexities are O(H) where H can go till N

Same set of keys can make different height BSTs

If we know the keys in advance, we can make a perfectly balanced BST.

Pick the middle make it root and do it recursively

How to control if user are providing input(no gurantee of order)

Idea : to do some extra work during inserting and deletion --> ROTATION

ROTATION : is O(1) operation
