-Use to represent hierarchy unline Array, ArrayList, Stack, Queue, Deque( they all are sequentials), tree non linear.
-Its recursive(has many trees inside it/subtree)

Descendants : All the nodes that lie in this subtree with this particular node as root
Degree of a node : Number of children it has(degree of leaf node : 0)
Internal Node : Node with degree !=0


Application of Trees
    - Organization Structure
    - Folder Structure
    - XML/HTML Content(JSON CONTENTS)
    - In OOPS(Inheritance)

-Binary Search Trees
-Binary Heap -> Used to represent Priority Queue
- B and B+ Trees --> used for indexing <-- or use hashing 
    Common is B and B+ Trees
- Computer Networks : Spanning(Used by Bridges) and shortest path tree(Used by routers)
- Parse Tree : Used by compiler to parse source code
- Trie : Used to represent dictionaries
- Suffix Tree
- Binary Index Tree : for range query searchs
- Segment Tree : : for range query searchs 

Segment Tree is more powerful but Binary Index Tree is faster for limited set of operations
