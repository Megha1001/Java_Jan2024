HASHING
----------------
- Used to implement dictionary
- Used to implement sets
- Below operations can be performed in O(1) time
    - Search, Insert and delete
- if we insert same key it will override its entry
    - In hash tables and hashing we always have unique values

Note : Self balancing binary tress - > AVL and Red-black takes O(logn) --> search and delete

- Hashing can't do certain operations (that other DS can do) -> HASHING IS STRICT SEARCH
    - Like finding smaller than the given key - > AVL and Red-black
    - key which is just above - > AVL and Red-black
    - Closest match -> HASHING WILL TAKE O(N)
    - Cannot get the data in sorted order by hashing


NOT USE HASHING :
    - Finding closest match -> AVL and Red-black can do
    - Sorted data  -> AVL and Red-black can do
    - Prefix searching -> TRIE can do



Collision handling
---------------------
- If we know keys in advance, then we can use Perfect hashing(that gurantees NO COLLISION)
- If we don't know the keys, then we use one of the following
    - Chaining
    - Open addressing
        - Linear probing
        - Quadratic Probing
        - Double Hashing

CHAINING
-----------------

Performance :
     m = no of slots in hash table
     n = no of keys to be inserted

     Load factor : n/m , should be less
     Expected chain length : Load factor, 
        Assumption : keys are going to distribute equally likely
    Expected search time : O(1+load factor)
        1 : time for hash function compulation
        loadfator : time to traverse chain
    Expected insert/delete :  O(1+load factor)
NOTE : ASSUMPTION THAT WE HAVE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF KEYS


DATA STRUCTure foR STORING CHAINS
    - Linked list
        - Insert(Need to search for duplicates as hash dont allow duplicates), Delete, and search : O(l)
        - LL is not cache friendly, use extra space for address/reference
    - Dynamic sized arrays(arralist)
        - Same as above but they are cache friendly and dont require extra space to store address
    - Self balancing BST (AVL, Red black)
        - Insert, Delete, and search : O(logl), they are not cache friendly

        where l is chain lengthv



OPEN ADDRESSING
--------------------
No of slots in Hash table >= No of keys to be inserted
Cache friendly
