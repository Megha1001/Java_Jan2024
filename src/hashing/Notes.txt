HASHING
----------------
- Used to implement dictionary
- Used to implement sets
- Below operations can be performed in O(1) time
    - Search, Insert and delete
- if we insert same key it will override its entry
    - In hash tables and hashing we always have unique values

Note : Self balancing binary tress - > AVL and Red-black takes O(logn) --> search and delete

- Hashing can't do certain operations (that other DS can do) -> HASHING IS STRICT SEARCH
    - Like finding smaller than the given key - > AVL and Red-black
    - key which is just above - > AVL and Red-black
    - Closest match -> HASHING WILL TAKE O(N)
    - Cannot get the data in sorted order by hashing


NOT USE HASHING :
    - Finding closest match -> AVL and Red-black can do
    - Sorted data  -> AVL and Red-black can do
    - Prefix searching -> TRIE can do
