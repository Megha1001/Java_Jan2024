GRAPHS : G(V,E)
---------------------
- Random connection among nodes


Types
---------------------
- Directed graph --> used by crawlers
    - indegree, outdegree
    - Sum of indegree : |E|
    - Sum of outdegree : |E|
    (Every edge contribute to one indegree and one outdegree)
    - Maximum number of edges : |V| * |V-1| [Maximum num of edges in undirected graph/2]
        When graph is completely connected , every vertex can connect to v-1 vertex. There are v vertex
- Undirected graph
    - Degree of vertex : Number of edges going through it.
    - Sum of degress : 2*|E| , (one edge contributes to 2 degree)
    - Maximum number of edges : (|v|*|V-1|)/2,

Note : Have not considered self loop
