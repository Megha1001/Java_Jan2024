Binary Heap
-----------------
- Used in heapsort
- Used to implement priority Queue


Two Types 
    - Min Heap(highest priority item is assigned lowest value)
    - Max heap(highest priority item is assigned highest value)


Use of priority queue
- Dijkstra's algo
- Prim's algo
- Huffman algo

- Binary heap is a complete binary tree(stored as an array(levelwise))

why there is a restriction to store as an array ?
- Because its stored as array and there should not be any gap in between them


left(i) = 2i+1
right(i) = 2i+2

parent(i)= floor(i-1)/2

Beauty of binary heap : dont have to store references


Min Heap
-------------
- Complete binary tree
- Every node has value smaller than its descendants
