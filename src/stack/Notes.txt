Application of Stacks
-----------------------
1. Function calls
2. Balanced paranthesis
3. Reversubg items
4. Infix to Prefix/Postfix
5. Evaluation of prefix/postfix
6. Stock span problem
7. Undo/Redo or Forward/Backward

---------------------------------------

what to use --> ??? ArrayDeque OR Stack
--> ANS : ArrayDeque


            -> List -> Vector -> Stack
Collection
            -> Queue -> Deque -> ArrayDeque


Vector is legacy it existed even when collection are not there and it has thread safety environment.

if we have single thred in that cause Stack will cause extra overhead. Hence, use ArrayDeque.
Both has same functions.

NOTE : Stack, Vector, ArrayDeque --> All use Arraylist based impl
hence TIME COMPLEXITIES for below operations
- pop -> amortized O(1)
- push -> amortized O(1)
- size, isEmpty, peek --> O(1)
